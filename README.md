  #Questions regarding the project

  Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

      Artemis Financial is a financial service company that manages financial protfolios for many clients in different parts of the world. They wanted to have our company build a RESTful web application
      that handles their customers sensitive data and keep it secure. The goal was to find any security vulnerabilities and reccomend security fixes to help keep that data secure.

  What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

    I identified security risks by manually reviewing the code for security risks and running a OWASP Dependency Check. It is importaant to code securly because any applications that are susceptible
    to attackers are at risk for data breaches. The value of software security to a company's well being is that it protects their customer data and helps maintain trust and fiancial stability for the business.

  Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

    The part of the vulnerability asesment that was challenging was determining what vulnerabilities were actual threats vs false positives. This helped me understand to always analyze the security findings
    instead of trusting that the tool is 100% accurate.

  How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

    I increased layers of security by reccomending stronger encryption, secure hashing, proper certificate usage, and better dependancy analysis. In the future, I would continue to use dependancy scanning tools,
    conduct secure code reviews, and utilize DevSecOps practices to asses the risks and choose the right security path forward to deliver a secure application.

  How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

    I made certain the code and software application was functional and secure by running the application and re running the dependency checks to make sure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

  What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

    What I learned with this class that will be helpful with completing future tasks was implimenting and running an OWASP dependancy check, utilize java security standards, use best practices with encryption,
    and utilize SecDevOps workflows.

  Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

      Future employers will see that I have the ability to identify software security risks, use industry standard tools, and recommend secure solutions to improve overall application security.
